## Building blocks of a web application

There are a few things you need to consider when building modern applications.

Such as:

- **User Interface** - how users will consume and interact with your application.
- **Routing** - how users navigate between different parts of your application.
- **Data Fetching** - where your data lives and how to get it.
- **Rendering** - when and where you render static or dynamic content.
- **Integrations** - what third-party services you use (for CMS, auth, payments, etc.) and how you connect to them.
- **Infrastructure** - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (serverless, CDN, edge, etc.).
- **Performance** - how to optimize your application for end-users.
- **Scalability** - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
- **Developer Experience** - your team's experience building and maintaining your application.

For each part of your application, you will need to decide whether you will build a solution yourself or use other tools, such as packages, libraries, and frameworks.
