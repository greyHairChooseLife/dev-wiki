# English Study Notes

## Summary of Common Patterns

Your messages show strong technical understanding and a willingness to ask detailed questions. However, several recurring language issues affect clarity and tone:

- **Unnatural expressions and phrasing**: Some sentences are awkward or confusing due to direct translation or word order.
- **Inappropriate vocabulary**: Occasional use of informal or offensive language that may be considered rude in professional or academic contexts.
- **Critical grammar issues**: Problems with verb tense, article usage, and sentence structure that can obscure your meaning.
- **Style inconsistencies**: Switching between formal and informal tone, and between English and Korean, can make your writing less cohesive.

**General Tips for Improvement:**
- Use clear, direct sentences and avoid unnecessary repetition.
- Maintain a polite and professional tone, especially when expressing frustration.
- Pay attention to verb tense and article usage.
- Try to keep your questions and statements concise.

## Detailed Error Analysis

### Unnatural Expressions or Nuance/Cultural Misunderstandings

> "I wonder if I catch the valid way to solve."
> - **Issue**: "Catch" is not the right verb here; the sentence structure is awkward.
> - **Alternative**: "I wonder if I have found the correct way to solve this."
> - **Note**: "Catch" is rarely used in this context. "Find" or "understand" are more natural.

> "Just say yes or no in 10 words."
> - **Issue**: This sounds abrupt and unclear. "In 10 words" is unnecessary if you only want "yes" or "no."
> - **Alternative**: "Please answer with just 'yes' or 'no.'"
> - **Note**: Direct requests should be polite and precise.

> "I'm not deleting. I just wonder I'm checking all kinds of case."
> - **Issue**: Sentence structure is confusing; "wonder I'm checking" is unnatural.
> - **Alternative**: "I'm not deleting anything. I just want to check if I have considered all possible cases."
> - **Note**: Use "want to check" instead of "wonder I'm checking."

> "I'm damn saying THIS IS NOT THE COMPLETED CODE."
> - **Issue**: "I'm damn saying" is not idiomatic and sounds aggressive.
> - **Alternative**: "I'm telling you, this is not the completed code."
> - **Note**: Avoid using "damn" in professional or academic communication.

> "I wrote kinda pseudo code and want you to check if that's alright structurall.y"
> - **Issue**: "kinda" and "structurall.y" are informal and misspelled.
> - **Alternative**: "I wrote some pseudocode and want you to check if its structure is correct."
> - **Note**: Use "pseudocode" and "structure" for clarity.

> "I am saying my code is just pseudo code and want you to check the case branching only. Not the got damn shit deleting."
> - **Issue**: "got damn shit" is offensive and inappropriate.
> - **Alternative**: "I only want you to check the case branching, not the deletion part."
> - **Note**: Avoid profanity; it is unprofessional and can offend readers.

> "help me understanding this. I will ask questions, you just answer it. Nothing more is needed."
> - **Issue**: "help me understanding" is incorrect; tone is abrupt.
> - **Alternative**: "Please help me understand this. I will ask questions, and I would appreciate brief answers."
> - **Note**: Use "help me understand" and maintain a polite tone.

> "what the hell."
> - **Issue**: Informal and potentially rude; lacks context.
> - **Alternative**: "I'm confused." or "I don't understand."
> - **Note**: Express confusion politely.

> "I got the point... damn you too good."
> - **Issue**: "damn you too good" is informal and could be misinterpreted.
> - **Alternative**: "I understand now. You're really good at explaining things."
> - **Note**: Compliments should be clear and polite.

### Vocabulary Choices or Inappropriate Vocabulary

> "Not the got damn shit deleting."
> - **Issue**: Profanity is inappropriate in most professional or academic contexts.
> - **Better options**: "Not the deletion part." or "Not the actual deletion code."
> - **Usage notes**: Profanity can offend or alienate your audience. Use neutral language.

> "what the hell."
> - **Issue**: Informal and potentially offensive.
> - **Better options**: "I'm confused." or "Can you clarify?"
> - **Usage notes**: Use polite expressions to maintain professionalism.

## Example Conversation

**Person A**: I wonder if I have found the correct way to solve this problem. Could you please answer with just "yes" or "no"?

**Person B**: Yes, your approach is correct.

**Person A**: I'm not deleting anything yet. I just want to check if I have considered all possible cases. I will implement deletion and re-linking later.

**Person B**: That sounds like a good plan. Let me know if you need help with the deletion part.

**Person A**: I wrote some pseudocode and want you to check if its structure is correct. Please focus only on the case branching, not the deletion code.

**Person B**: Sure, I'll review the case branching in your pseudocode.

**Person A**: What do you think about my changes? Is my code correct now?

**Person B**: Your changes look good. The code correctly deletes the node and updates the tree structure.

**Person A**: In C, can I access a variable after freeing it? I mean just reading its value.

**Person B**: No, you should not access a variable after freeing it. Doing so can cause undefined behavior.
