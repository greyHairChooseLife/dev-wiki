## Summary of Common Patterns

- Occasional missing articles (a, the) in questions
- Some awkward phrasing when asking technical questions
- Minor structural issues in more complex sentences
- Generally strong vocabulary with a few idiomatic expressions that could be refined


## Detailed Error Analysis

### Unnatural Expressions or Nuance/Cultural Misunderstandings

> "I'd like to get the number how many windows exist on current session."
> - **Issue**: Missing preposition and article make this sound unnatural
> - **Alternative**: "I'd like to get the number of how many windows exist on the current session."
> - **Note**: A more concise version would be "I'd like to find out how many windows exist in the current session."

> "It's not something presented under the file tree. But on the right upper side."
> - **Issue**: Fragment and non-standard position description
> - **Alternative**: "It's not something presented under the file tree, but in the upper right corner."
> - **Note**: Native speakers typically say "upper right" rather than "right upper"

> "I'd love to run things with open source from OS level."
> - **Issue**: Missing article and preposition makes this sound unnatural
> - **Alternative**: "I'd love to run things with open source software from the OS level."
> - **Note**: Adding "software" makes the meaning clearer

> "what happen if I jsut quit the browser?"
> - **Issue**: Incorrect verb form for a hypothetical question
> - **Alternative**: "What happens if I just quit the browser?"
> - **Note**: Questions about hypothetical situations use present tense "happens" not "happen"

> "When I initiate new project, I usually make dir, and `git init`."
> - **Issue**: Missing articles makes this sound unnatural
> - **Alternative**: "When I initiate a new project, I usually make a directory, and run `git init`."
> - **Note**: Adding articles makes this sound more natural to native speakers

> "Btw, is that called REPL when I boot up my system?"
> - **Issue**: Awkward phrasing of a technical question
> - **Alternative**: "Btw, is the terminal I see after booting up my system called a REPL?"
> - **Note**: Restructuring makes the technical question clearer

### Vocabulary Choices or Inappropriate Vocabulary

> "What is the workload for add up the PWD?"
> - **Issue**: Incorrect technical term (PWD vs PWA) and awkward phrasing
> - **Better options**: "What is the workload for adding PWA functionality?"
> - **Usage notes**: In this context, "PWD" refers to "present working directory" while "PWA" refers to "Progressive Web App" which is what was being discussed

> "Now they want a kiosk system for their customers or clients."
> - **Issue**: Redundant terms - in most business contexts, these terms have different meanings
> - **Better options**: Use "customers" consistently if referring to end-users, or distinguish between "clients" (businesses) and "customers" (end-users) if both exist
> - **Usage notes**: Without clarification, using both terms creates ambiguity about who will be using the system

### Critical Grammar Issues

> "If someone suggest this rule below, what does this mean?"
> - **Issue**: Subject-verb agreement error (someone is singular)
> - **Correction**: "If someone suggests this rule below, what does this mean?"
> - **Rule**: Singular subjects (like "someone") require singular verb forms ("suggests")

> "That makes it don't need `read` project directory."
> - **Issue**: Incorrect auxiliary verb with "it"
> - **Correction**: "That makes it doesn't need to `read` project directory."
> - **Rule**: After "makes it", use "doesn't" (not "don't") as "it" is singular


## Example Conversation

**Person A**: I'd like to find out how many windows exist in the current session. Is there a tmux command for that?

**Person B**: Yes, you can use the command "tmux list-windows | wc -l" to count the number of windows in your current session.

**Person A**: Thanks! I'm looking for a Visual Studio Code extension that shows code structure in the upper right corner. Do you know what it's called?

**Person B**: You're probably referring to the "Outline" view, which is built into VS Code. You can access it by clicking on the outline icon in the Explorer view or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+O.

**Person A**: What happens if I just quit the browser when running my kiosk application? Will it return to the command line?

**Person B**: Yes, if you quit the browser in a kiosk setup, you'll typically return to whatever shell or environment was running underneath itâ€”usually the command line interface or terminal.

**Person A**: When I initiate a new project, I usually make a directory and run `git init`. Is there a way to automate this process?

**Person B**: Absolutely! You could create a shell script that takes a project name as input, creates the directory, changes into it, and runs git init automatically. Many developers use templates or project scaffolding tools for this exact purpose.
