# English Study Notes

## Summary of Common Patterns

Your English is generally clear and effective for technical communication, especially in programming and system contexts. However, there are recurring patterns that can be improved for greater clarity and professionalism:

- **Unnatural expressions and awkward phrasing**: Some sentences are direct translations from Korean or use informal/slang expressions that may sound abrupt or confusing to native speakers.
- **Critical grammar issues**: Occasional problems with verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and article usage.
- **Vocabulary choices**: Use of inappropriate or overly informal vocabulary in technical contexts.
- **Style inconsistencies**: Switching between formal and informal styles, sometimes within the same message.

**General Tips for Improvement:**
- Aim for consistent tone and style, especially in professional or technical writing.
- Use standard English expressions and avoid slang or direct translations.
- Pay attention to verb tense and sentence structure for clarity.
- When asking questions, use polite and clear forms.

## Detailed Error Analysis

### Unnatural Expressions or Nuance/Cultural Misunderstandings

> "nha, I just want to replicate the key input. the comments was trash."
> - **Issue**: "nha" is not standard English; "the comments was trash" is very informal and could be considered rude.
> - **Alternative**: "No, I just want to replicate the key input. The comments were not helpful."
> - **Note**: Avoid slang ("trash") in technical discussions; "nha" is likely a Korean filler and should be replaced with "No" or "Actually".

> "I am not fucking tpying heak but I will move my cursor to the left and then e for placing it the end of word and then type k or whatever one character and delete with Backspace. You got it?"
> - **Issue**: Use of profanity ("fucking"), unclear phrasing, and run-on sentence.
> - **Alternative**: "I'm not typing 'heak'. Instead, I move my cursor to the left, press 'e' to go to the end of the word, type 'k' or another character, and then delete it with Backspace. Do you understand?"
> - **Note**: Profanity is inappropriate in most professional or technical contexts. Break long sentences for clarity.

> "nah, while running cat or something else."
> - **Issue**: "nah" is informal and unclear in this context.
> - **Alternative**: "No, I mean while running 'cat' or another command."
> - **Note**: Use "No" or "Not really" for negative responses.

> "I tought splitting the block."
> - **Issue**: Incorrect verb form ("tought" instead of "thought"), missing object.
> - **Alternative**: "I thought about splitting the block."

> - **Issue**: "works one by one" is awkward.
> - **Alternative**: "Well, even if the application calls free() randomly, the two free() functions run sequentially, right?"
> - **Note**: Use "run sequentially" for clarity.

> "so, the free function never run recursively, or iterate until it breaks out of it but just next free call would merge again?"
> - **Issue**: Awkward phrasing.
> - **Alternative**: "So, the free function never runs recursively or iterates until it finishes; instead, the next free call would merge again?"

> - **Better options**: "I'm not typing 'heak'..."
> - **Usage notes**: Avoid profanity in technical or professional communication.

> "the comments was trash."
> - **Issue**: "trash" is very informal and can be offensive.
> - **Better options**: "The comments were not helpful." / "The comments were unclear."
> - **Usage notes**: Use neutral language to describe problems.

### Critical Grammar Issues

> "the comments was trash."
> - **Issue**: Subject-verb agreement ("comments was" should be "comments were").
> - **Correction**: "The comments were trash." (but see vocabulary note above)
> - **Rule**: Plural subjects require plural verbs.

> "I am is still confused."
> - **Issue**: Redundant verb ("am is").
> - **Correction**: "I am still confused."
> - **Rule**: Use only one verb per subject.

> "I tought splitting the block."
> - **Issue**: Incorrect verb form ("tought" instead of "thought").
> - **Correction**: "I thought about splitting the block."
> - **Rule**: Use correct past tense forms.

> "why is that unsable?"
> - **Issue**: "unsable" is not a word.

> - **Correction**: "So, this is not deferred merging, right?"
> - **Rule**: Use correct spelling.

> "is that safe againt thrashing while allocate and free constantly for a tiny amount of data?"
> - **Issue**: "againt" should be "against"; missing gerunds.
> - **Correction**: "Is that safe against thrashing when allocating and freeing small amounts of data repeatedly?"
> - **Rule**: Use "when" + gerund for describing actions.

> "maybe recursively? oh, no. there won't be sequencial freed blocks."
> - **Issue**: "sequencial" should be "sequential".
> - **Correction**: "Maybe recursively? Oh, no, there won't be sequential freed blocks."
> - **Rule**: Use correct spelling.

## Example Conversation

**Person A**: I'm still confused. Why is splitting the block sometimes unusable in the first-fit placement policy?

**Person B**: Splitting the block can create small fragments that are unusable for future allocations. If the remainder is too small, it can't be used, which leads to wasted space.

**Person A**: So, generally, is it not recommended to split blocks every time?

**Person B**: It's recommended only if the remainder is large enough to be useful. Otherwise, it's better to use the entire block to avoid unusable fragments.

**Person A**: Is that safe against thrashing when allocating and freeing small amounts of data repeatedly?

**Person B**: Not always. Frequent allocation and freeing of small blocks can cause thrashing, especially if merging isn't handled efficiently.

**Person A**: I thought about using both methods: deferred merging for small allocations and immediate merging for others. Would that work?

**Person B**: That could work, but it adds complexity. Most allocators use one consistent merging strategy for simplicity and reliability.

**Person A**: Thanks for clarifying. Can you summarize this topic so I can review it later?

**Person B**: Sure! Splitting blocks helps reduce internal fragmentation, but only if the remainder is large enough. Merging strategies help prevent thrashing and false fragmentation. Choose the strategy that best fits your application's allocation patterns.
